# project_euler
This repository contains solutions that I wrote to solve problem on https://projecteuler.net/. 
All solutions are written in Python.

Some problems may have 2 possible solutions: a simple & straight-forward and an advanced and optimized one. You can easily identify which problems have 2 solutions by looking at file names.

Normal solution is one that solved by normal problem solving process.
Advance solution uses better algorithm and different way of approaching the problem.
