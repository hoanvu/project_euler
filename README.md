# project_euler
This repository contains solutions that I wrote to solve problem on https://projecteuler.net/. 
All solutions are written in Python.

Each problem will have 2 solutions: normal and advance.
Normal solution is one that solved by normal problem solving process.
Advance solution uses better algorithm and different way of approaching the problem.
